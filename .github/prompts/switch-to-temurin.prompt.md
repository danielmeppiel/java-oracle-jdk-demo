## Execution Plan
> Note: This is an auto-generated execution plan, you can take it as a reference. It's READONLY and you can NOT modify it.
0. Understand what changes from Oracle JDK to Temurin JDK from this Repository: https://github.com/danielmeppiel/java-oracle-jdk-demo . Fetch it if needed.
1. Perform the initial code modifications using tool #javaupgrade_openrewrite, but this is usually not enough.
    * You will need to manually perform the version upgrades for Java and dependencies if OpenRewrite faild to do so.
2. Check for any build errors and fix them using tool #javaupgrade_build_fix
    * You will need to fix the build errors by yourself if it fails to fix them automatically using the provided tool.
    * Remember to invoke tool #javaupgrade_build_project to validate your fix.
3. Check for any other issue (e.g. CVE issues, code behavior changes and test failures) and fix them, remember to invoke tool #javaupgrade_build_project to validate the code changes after each fix.
    1. Check for any CVE issues using tool #javaupgrade_validate_cves and fix the **Critical**, **High** and **Medium** severity ones.
    2. Check for invalid code behavioral changes using tool #javaupgrade_validate_code_behavior_consistency and fix the **Critical** and **Major** severity ones.
    3. Check for any test errors/failures using tool #javaupgrade_run_tests and fix those related to this upgrade.
4. You may repeat step 2 and 3 for several attempts until the project builds successfully and all additional issues are fixed.
5. Finally, Remember to summarize all the changes made during this upgrading process using tool #javaupgrade_summarize_upgrade after the process is complete, no matter if the project builds successfully or not.
